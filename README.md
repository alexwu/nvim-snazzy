# nvim-snazzy

> Based on the wonderful [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy/) and [vim-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy/)
> Used [zephyr-nvim](https://github.com/glepnir/zephyr-nvim) as the basis for porting Snazzy to lua.

Snazzy NeoVim theme written in Lua with some basic treesitter support!

Will be updated as I find things that annoy me about it, which is currently a lot of things.
